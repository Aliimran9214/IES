# Easy IES
An easy to use program that generates custom IES files

These files can be used in game engines like unreal and unity, or other real time rendering applications to increase the quality of your lighting.

This program gives you several configuration options that can be changed to simulate different types and shapes of lamp shades. You can configure the angle of the top and bottom of the shade and adjust the amount of light absorbed, and add noise to the light that makes it through the shade to make it look more realistic.

Currently, only cylindrical, open top and bottom style lamp shades are supported. You can make directional or spotlight style lights by setting the top or bottom shade angles to 0, but they aren't perfect. I plan to make more modes for directional lights, and maybe even oblong or rectangular shaped lamps.

# Contribution
Contribution is welcome, feel free to make a pull request or contact me with your ideas.

If you like Easy IES and would like to support its development, the best way is by a donation. I don't have a lot of time to dedicate to this project because my financial situation is less than ideal. Even a small donation would be greatly appreciated. I would like to spend more time on this project, I have a lot of good ideas for it. But rent is expensive.
